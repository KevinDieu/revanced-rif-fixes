"""Rewrite bundles/stable.json and bundles/latest.json from this repo's GitHub releases.

ReVanced Manager adds a remote patch bundle from a small JSON file that points at the release's patches.rvp.
After publishing a release, run this and commit the result:

    python scripts/update_bundle_json.py

stable.json follows the newest regular release; latest.json also follows pre-releases.
Standard library only; GitHub's public API needs no token.
